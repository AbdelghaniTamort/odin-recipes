    <h2>  Description </h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish composed of layers of rich, flavorful ingredients. It begins with a hearty meat sauce made from ground beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs, simmered until thick and aromatic. This sauce is alternated with sheets of tender lasagna pasta and a creamy, velvety mixture of ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan. Each layer is generously topped with shredded mozzarella cheese, which melts and bubbles to a golden perfection in the oven. The lasagna is baked until the top is beautifully browned and crispy, and the layers meld together in a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, resulting in a comforting, savory masterpiece.
